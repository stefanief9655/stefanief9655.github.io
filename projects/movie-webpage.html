            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <p>My goal with this project was to, along with my partner (Ayda), create a website to advertise the trailer to a movie we created. To do this, I used my knowledge of HTML and CSS, that I learnt from my 
                Software Emgineering Teacher, Mr. Mueller and Freecodecamp.org.</p>
            <p>My partner and I decided that we wanted to make our movie be a spinoff of Cocomelon. We used some characters from the show and had them go on an adventure. 2 of these characters being toddlers who had 
                little crushes on eachother. We sucessfully reached our goal, while making sure to communicate with eachother and do our parts. </p>
            <p>This project was pretty straight forward. We were given a list of requirements that needed to be included, but the dificult part with this was actually including all the parts. Most of the things I've 
                created so far never had all of these elements in one site. From this project I learned that I need to better manage my time. I found myself towards the end rushing to finish things. I also need to 
                pay more attention to detail. Sometimes the smallest mistakes can have very large imapacts. For example, when adding margins to an element, I would mistakenly use the element margins rather then margin.
                Adding that s, doesn't allow that line of code to run. If I had more time to work on this project, I would add a sequal to the trailer and try and make the site more interactive for the viewer. </p>
